we'll be having a rules object and a person should be able to see the final set rules after setting them
enforcements

We'll start from the sermoners 


service days are gonna be thesame for everybody. so they should be constructed at the begining for everyone
and stored. 

select month. Service schemas should be calculated and kept for the entire year
Allowed services: weekdays only, wednesday only, friday only, sunday only...list
Allowed officiation: Service, lesson, sermon....list
enforce on particular days:  3rd January: First wednesday....list


####### Second Approach
pick any random service and fix the officiator
putting into consideration the number of times they have been chosen and the rank

######## Third Approach
choose service conductors First

total monthly slots
number of officiators and number of officiations....how many each person gets depends on how many of that
  particular officiation available and the number of officiators available for that officiation


set month
set rules while entering officiators
