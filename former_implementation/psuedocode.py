#when creating officiators, we put each of them in a list: service_conductors_pool, lesson_readers_pool and preachers_pool
#depending on their can fields. 
#we also keep in a list everyone that has an enforcement
#pull already created services from a file

#pick a service
#start with the conductor. pick from the pool of conductors    #should I remove the person temporarily????
#if within limit
    #check rank
        #if of lower rank:
            #pick again
        #else
            #put the person and increase their conunt for that officiation



#if limit reached:
    #remove from that officiation list
    #pick again


#the chooser will house all of these data...conduct_limit, preach_limit, read_limit
